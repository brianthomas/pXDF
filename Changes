        This one is a big leap forward. Many changes;
	- Added correct href functionality for files.
          Other URL types not currently enabled.
          Added Href class.
        - Added ability to carry along XML Notation nodes
          in the base object and print back out wi/ toXMLFileHandle
        - <!ENTITY> stuff now printing out for href nodes. 
        - Changed method invocation to Java style, e.g.
          get/set. There is compatability mode for older
          attribute access (for now).
        - Fixed deep cloning (finally!). Removed silly
          setRef stuff from BaseObject class as a result.
        - Notes node now will appear in output array w/ correct
          layout, e.g. locationOrder + notes children. Added
          Notes and NotesLocatorOrder classes.
        - Delimited read section not printing correctly fixed. 
        - Fixed ability to change order of read Axis (e.g. invert
          an array) from the XML file. Does the right thing now
          (see XDF_sample2 file). 
        - Removed extraneous code (_enlarge_array, etc) from DataCube.
        - Fixed numerous bugs in the Locator incl. its ability
          to find the correct Axes from the parent and change its
          iteration order and the order of traversal for next method.
