0.17l Mon Dec 16 02:51 2000
        This one is a big leap forward. Many changes;
	- Added correct href functionality for files.
          Other URL types not currently enabled.
          Added Href class.
        - Added ability to carry along XML Notation nodes
          in the base object and print back out wi/ toXMLFileHandle
        - <!ENTITY> stuff now printing out for href nodes. 
        - Changed method invocation to Java style, e.g.
          get/set. There is compatability mode for older
          attribute access (for now).
        - Fixed deep cloning (finally!). Removed silly
          setRef stuff from BaseObject class as a result.
        - Notes node now will appear in output array w/ correct
          layout, e.g. locationOrder + notes children. Added
          Notes and NotesLocatorOrder classes.
        - Delimited read section not printing correctly fixed. 
        - Fixed ability to change order of read Axis (e.g. invert
          an array) from the XML file. Does the right thing now
          (see XDF_sample2 file). 
        - Removed extraneous code (_enlarge_array, etc) from DataCube.
        - Fixed numerous bugs in the Locator incl. its ability
          to find the correct Axes from the parent and change its
          iteration order and the order of traversal for next method.

0.17-beta0 Fri Mar 14 05:31 2001
        - changed getBytes() method name to numOfBytes to conform w/ Java API
        - combined Fixed and Exponential dataFormat classes as FloatDataFormat.
        - added in Utility and Constants classes, shifted class data as needed
          into new Constants class.
        - Binary IO now conforms to the XDF standard. Non-native writting of 
          binary floats now supported.
        - fixed a number of bugs in the Locator. Most importantly, hasNext 
          method now works without forgetting about the last datum and is more
          intellegently implemented.
        - updated the guiview.pl program (in samples sub-directory). Much more
          functionality added.
        - changed makeDoc.pl to not print out object attributes, more closely 
          conforms to Java HTML documentation. 
        = fixed inital page and interlinkage bugs in makeHTMLDoc.pl. 
        - reviewed methods, more closely aligned with the Java package. 
        - added Append array functionality.
        - fixed bug in ID/IDREF stuff. Was not getting unique name for more than
          2 ref's nodes.
        - upgraded the guiview program. Now has slicker interface, some editing 
          functions and writing capability. This sub-program is NOT beta quality 
          software however(!!). Much needed functionality missing/incomplete and
          many bugs remain (!). 


0.17-beta1 Wed Apr 25 12:31 2001 
	- allow user-defined start, end, charData handlers as per Java.
        - added XMLElement class to capture interior XML nodes as per the XDF DTD.
        - added BaseObjectWithXMLElements class to provide needed additional methods
          for some classes to hold interior XML Element nodes.
        - fixed starthandlers in Reader.pm to return the object they create (where possible)
        - regularized the axis ordering between the IterationOrderlist for the 
          locator and the writeAxisOrderList for XMLDataIOStyle. The first axis
          is the list is the *fastest*. TaggedData now has a setWriteAxisOrderList
          method but its use is forbidden (and meaningless) for now. 
        - added XDF::DOM and related classes XDF::DOM::Parser, XDF::DOM::Document
          and XDF::DOM::Element. These allow the IO and manipulation of any
          XML document and still may use the XDF API on the XDF bits of the XML 
          document for easier handling.
        - added Specification class singleton as per Java package.
        - added toString output method in BaseObject.
        - fixed up XDF_DOC a bit. Still needs work.


0.17-beta2 ??? ??? 2001
	- fixed bug wherein float, integer numbers were left- instead of right-justified.
        - added setCData method to XMLElement class.
        - fixed html doc generation utility to make pages IE can read.
        - added compression for data in external files. Not great a implementation.
	- added logarithm attribute to Units class.
	- changed internal storage of data in DataCube. Got rid of nasty eval statements.
	  much faster now, but still not as fast as native (C) implementation (e.g. PDL).
	- Units node not getting attributes parsed by the Reader (eep!). Fixed.
        - More addjustment to bring API into argreement with Java: public add methods now
          return boolean rather than an object.
