INTRODUCTION
------------

This is the XDF Perl Package courtesy of the Astronomical Data 
Center (ADC) at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center.
XDF is the 'eXtensible Data Format' and is an attempt to make
XML behave nicely with scientific/mathematical data. This package
provides the classes for easy manipulation and IO of XDF objects. 
See our website: http://xml.gsfc.nasa.gov and linkage within for 
more information.

This package is "beta", meaning we have all of the forseen functionality
incorportated in the code. "beta" also means that many bugs remain.
Please refer to the TODO list for an idea of what remains to
be done to bring this package to full stable reality. One important goal: 
Im interested in using the Xerces parser that I hear the
Apache group is developing for Perl (http://xml.apache.org).
More work on that is to come soon I hope.

A (slightly incomplete) diagram of the XDF object model appears
in the UML-XDF.gif image. There is addtional information in
the file-by-file docs. Build the HTML docs using the utility
contained in utils. 

Refer to the "samples" directory for working code and example XDF files.


LICENCE 
-------

This package is released under the GNU Public Licence. Please refer LICENCE file
for the details.


INSTALL
-------

This package should work on both W9x and UNIX platforms (and
perhaps others, but thats all I've tested on so far); Note
that the makefiles only compliant with UNIX make so W9x users
will have to install by hand. One day, when I have the time, 
I will look into creatation of a PPD file for this distribution.

You will need to install the following packages:

   XML-Parser-2.27
   libxml-enno-1.04pre4 
 
You may get XML-Parser from CPAN. Unfortuneately, libxml-enno-1.04
is not available there (yet). You can get the libxml-enno from
the maintainers website at: http://tjmather.com/CPAN.  As a side note,
I have also used XML-Parser-2.30 to good effect. Other versions,
notably XML-Parser 2.28 dont work as well for me. You mileage may
vary and you may have to experiment with various versions of the 
XML-Parser package to find the stablest one that works for you.

Now, untar both files. You will need to APPLY A PATCH (in the file
"DOM.patch") to the libxml-enno distribution if you want Href entities 
to work properly (Note: this patch may not apply to versions of 
libxml-enno later than 1.04pre4, check the source to know :):

> cd libxml-enno-1.04pre4
> patch -p0 < <XDFdirectory>/DOM.patch

Now, after having met the above requirements, make the packages 
(XML-Parser, libxml-enno, then XDF) via the standard Perl drill:

> perl Makefile.PL; make ; make test ; make install

Additional HTML documentation may be made by running the script
util/makeHTMLDoc.pl AFTER you have built the distribution.


Problems with Perl Package
--------------------------

Having said the above, I have noticed that problems will occur
with the handling of external entities (e.g. they arent currently
supported very well) using the libxml-enno parser. Part of the
problem seems to be the LWP handler, but Im not 100% sure. Hopefully
the maintainers can resolve this issue before too long. 

Also, in order to use compression, you will have to edit the path
to the compress executables in Constants.pm. Do this BEFORE install
to save yourself a headache. I hope to integrate this into the 
make proceedure in the future.


FTP & CVS Repository Access
----======-----------------

Read only access to the nightly snapshot is allowed for people who
have downloaded this code once from the main site. The CVS account
is "guest" which has a password "gu3stacc3ss". The XDF Perl package
directory is "xml/XDF/Perl_Package" and the CVSROOT directory is
"/home/cvsadmin/src". Here is an example of how you can use this
information to obtain a nightly CVS snapshot (UNIX tcsh):

> setenv CVSROOT :pserver:guest@xdf.gsfc.nasa.gov:/home/cvsadmin/src

> cvs login
  (this will ask for a password, which is "gu3stacc3ss")

> cvs checkout xml/XDF/Perl_Package

Note that you only have to use "cvs login" step ONCE. Thereafter, you
only need to "update" to obtain the latest copy from CVS, e.g:

> cvs update xml/XDF/Perl_Package

Access to the nightly snapshot via FTP is via the "guest" account is also
available from xdf.gsfc.nasa.gov. Use your email address as a password to
log in.
