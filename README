INTRODUCTION
------------

This is the XDF Perl Package courtesy of the 
Astronomical Data Center (ADC) at NASA/Goddard
Space Flight Center.

Please refer to the TODO list for an idea of what remains to
be done to bring this package to full featuredom.

A (slightly incomplete) diagram of the XDF object model appears
in the UML-XDF.gif image. There is addtional information in
the file-by-file docs. Build the HTML docs using the utility
contained in utils. 


LICENCE 
-------

Please refer LICENCE file.


INSTALL
-------

This package should work on both W32 and UNIX platforms.
To make it, do the standard drill:

> perl Makefile.PL; make ; make test ; make install

(W32 users substitute NMAKE for 'make' in the above )


Problems with Perl Package
--------------------------

Having said the above, I have noticed that problems will occur
with the handling of external entities (e.g. they arent currently
supported) using the libxml-enno validating parser. I have also
had problems with the recent XML-Parser-2.30 release. I develop
this package using XML-Parser-2.29. Im interested in trying to 
use the XML parser that I hear the apache group is developing for
Perl. More work on that is to come I hope.


CVS Repository Access
---------------------

Read only access to the nightly snapshot is allowed for people who
have downloaded this code once from the main site. The CVS account
is "guest" which has a password "gu3stacc3ss". The XDF Perl package
directory is "xml/XDF/Perl_Package" and the CVSROOT directory is
"/home/cvsadmin/src". Here is an example of how you can use this
information to obtain a nightly CVS snapshot (UNIX tcsh):

> setenv CVSROOT :pserver:guest@xdf.gsfc.nasa.gov:/home/cvsadmin/src

> cvs login
  (this will ask for a password, which is "gu3stacc3ss")

> cvs checkout xml/XDF/Perl_Package

Note that you only have to use "cvs login" step ONCE. Thereafter, only
the last step is needed to obtain a copy from CVS.
