INTRODUCTION
------------

This is the XDF Perl Package courtesy of the Astronomical Data 
Center (ADC) at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center.
XDF is the 'eXtensible Data Format' and is an attempt to make
XML behave nicely with scientific, mathematical data. This package
provides the classes for easy manipulation and IO of XDF objects
(which are written in XML, see our website: http://xml.gsfc.nasa.gov
and linkage within for more information).

Please refer to the TODO list for an idea of what remains to
be done to bring this package to full featuredom.

A (slightly incomplete) diagram of the XDF object model appears
in the UML-XDF.gif image. There is addtional information in
the file-by-file docs. Build the HTML docs using the utility
contained in utils. 


LICENCE

Please refer LICENCE file.


INSTALL
-------

This package should work on both W9x and UNIX platforms (and
perhaps others, but thats all I've tested on so far); Note
that the makefiles only compliant with UNIX make so W9x users
will have to install by hand. One day, when I have the time, 
I will look into creatation of a PPD file for this distribution.

You will need to install the following packages:

   XML-Parser 
   libxml-enno
 
which you may both get from CPAN. I understand that there are more 
advanced version of libxml-enno than you can normally get off
of the CPAN site available from the maintainers website 
(http://tjmather.com/CPAN). 

After having met the above requirements, make the package
via the standard Perl drill:

> perl Makefile.PL; make ; make test ; make install

Additional HTML documentation may be made by running the script
util/makeHTMLDoc.pl AFTER you have built the distribution.


Problems with Perl Package
--------------------------

Having said the above, I have noticed that problems will occur
with the handling of external entities (e.g. they arent currently
supported) using the libxml-enno validating parser.

Im interested in trying to use the Xerces parser that I hear the 
Apache group is developing for Perl (http://xml.apache.org). 
More work on that is to come I hope.


CVS Repository Access
---------------------

Read only access to the nightly snapshot is allowed for people who
have downloaded this code once from the main site. The CVS account
is "guest" which has a password "gu3stacc3ss". The XDF Perl package
directory is "xml/XDF/Perl_Package" and the CVSROOT directory is
"/home/cvsadmin/src". Here is an example of how you can use this
information to obtain a nightly CVS snapshot (UNIX tcsh):

> setenv CVSROOT :pserver:guest@xdf.gsfc.nasa.gov:/home/cvsadmin/src

> cvs login
  (this will ask for a password, which is "gu3stacc3ss")

> cvs checkout xml/XDF/Perl_Package

Note that you only have to use "cvs login" step ONCE. Thereafter, only
the last step is needed to obtain a copy from CVS.
