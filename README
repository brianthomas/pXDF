INTRODUCTION
------------

This is the XDF Perl Package courtesy of the Astronomical Data 
Center (ADC) at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center.
XDF is the 'eXtensible Data Format' and is an attempt to make
XML behave nicely with scientific/mathematical data. This package
provides the classes for easy manipulation and IO of XDF objects. 
See our website: http://xml.gsfc.nasa.gov/XDF/XDF_home.html and 
the linkage within for more information on XDF and XML activities
in general at the ADC.

This package is "beta", meaning we have all of the forseen functionality
incorportated in the code. "Beta" also means that many bugs remain 
and that the API may undergo minor changes. Please refer to the TODO 
list for an idea of what remains to be done to bring this package to 
full stable reality. One important goal worth mentioning here is 
attempting to bring in support for other XML parsers for XDF. Currently
only the XML-DOM/XML-Parser combination is supported, however, Im 
interested in using the Xerces parser that I hear the Apache group is 
developing for Perl (http://xml.apache.org).  Also, I have recently 
heard good things about libXML for Perl, and plan to investigate 
implementing that in XDF too. 

A (slightly out of date) diagram of the XDF object model appears
in the UML-XDF.gif image. There is addtional information in
the file-by-file docs. Build the HTML docs using the utility
contained in utils. 

Refer to the "samples" directory for working code and example XDF 
files.


LICENCE 
-------

This package is released under the GNU Public Licence. Please refer 
LICENCE file for the details.


INSTALL
-------

This package should work on both W9x and UNIX platforms (and
perhaps others, but thats all I've tested on so far); Note
that the makefiles only compliant with UNIX make so W9x users
will have to install by hand. One day, when I have the time, 
I will look into creatation of a PPD file for this distribution.

You will need to install the following packages:

   XML-Parser-2.30
   XML-DOM-1.31
 
You may get both packages from CPAN. I have also used XML-DOM-2.30 
to good effect, but its probably best to upgrade, your mileage may
vary :). 

Now, untar both files. You will need to APPLY A PATCH (in the file
"DOM.patch") to the XML-DOM distribution if you want Href entities 
to work properly; I have included it here for your convience.

> cd XML-DOM-1.31
> patch -p0 < <XDFdirectory>/DOM.patch

Now, change directory into each XML-Parser and then XML-DOM and
 make the packages via the standard Perl drill:

> cd XML-Parser-2.30
> perl Makefile.PL; make ; make test ; make install

(and similar for XML-DOM package)

Finally, you are ready to install perl XDF. Just do:

> cd <XDFdirector>
> perl Makefile.PL; make ; make test ; make install

as for any standard perl package. 

Additional HTML documentation may be made by running the script
util/makeHTMLDoc.pl AFTER you have built the distribution.


Problems with Perl Package
--------------------------

Having said the above, I have noticed that problems will occur
with the handling of external entities (e.g. they arent currently
supported very well) using the libxml-enno parser. Part of the
problem seems to be the LWP handler, but Im not 100% sure. Hopefully
the maintainers can resolve this issue before too long. 

Also, in order to use compression, you will have to edit the path
to the compress executables in Constants.pm. If you have already
installed the package, no problem, just hammer it over with a quick
"make install" from the <XDFdirectory>. I hope to integrate this into 
the make proceedure in the future.


FTP & CVS Repository Access
---------------------------

Read-only access to the nightly snapshot is allowed for people who
have downloaded this code once from the main site. The CVS account
is "guest" which has a password "gu3stacc3ss". The XDF Perl package
directory is "xml/XDF/Perl_Package" and the CVSROOT directory is
"/home/cvsadmin/src". Here is an example of how you can use this
information to obtain a nightly CVS snapshot (UNIX tcsh):

> setenv CVSROOT :pserver:guest@xdf.gsfc.nasa.gov:/home/cvsadmin/src

> cvs login
  (this will ask for a password, which is "gu3stacc3ss")

> cvs checkout xml/XDF/Perl_Package

Note that you only have to use "cvs login" step ONCE. Thereafter, you
only need to "update" to obtain the latest copy from CVS, e.g:

> cvs update xml/XDF/Perl_Package

Access to the nightly snapshot via FTP is via the "guest" account is
also available from xdf.gsfc.nasa.gov. Use your email address as a 
password to log in.
