This is the XDF Perl Package courtesy of the 
Astronomical Data Center (ADC) at NASA/Goddard

Please refer to the TODO list for an idea of what remains to
be done to bring this package to full featuredom.

A (slightly incomplete) diagram of the XDF object model appears
in the UML-XDF.gif image. There is addtional information in
the file-by-file docs. Build the HTML docs using the utility
contained in utils.

Please refer LICENCE file.


INSTALL
-------

This package should work on both W32 and UNIX platforms.
To make it, do the standard drill:

(W32 users substitute NMAKE for 'make' in the above )
