   ** Known bugs/Issues in the BETA that prevent use from calling this a stable 
      feature-complete release candidate.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   - read external files with delmited/tagged data styles

   - binary IO not well tested (only on Linux so far). 

   - Href stuff only supports files. Need Entity Resolver type behavior ala Java.
     This may be a bug in libxml-enno that we need to patch.
  
   - incorporate compression executable configuration for the package into 
     the make proceedure.

   - implement set/getRecord for dataCube.

   - CDATA sections are needed to wrap data for proper reading. Shouldnt regular text
     reading be supported too?

   - dataStyleId/dataStyleIdRef implemented, however problems will result if dataStyleIdRef
     is specified AND the dataStyle node has child nodes. We probably need to 
     prevent the user from doing this in the DTD (err. schema).

   - Programmer interface for manipulation of notes/notes location is yucky.
     We need to use locator objects in the notes, same as we need to do in Java Package.
     (e.g. Fix XDF::Note setLocation method related stuff).

   - ID/REF stuff not handled satisfactorily, but we are blowing up the storage
     requirements for objects using the deep clone operation. Perhaps we
     need to create a half-way cloning? or store interally (via private field)
     the name of the object we idref'd. Hemm..
     Plus we should hide all this nasty-ness from the programmer to begin with.

   - Review the functionality to attributes on data node.
     -- Href capability (Done for files only, what about other types of URLs?)
     -- compression (Only BZIP2, GZIP and compress implemented and it only works on UNIX systems)

   - Need a better treatment of relation node for multiple fields ids. 

   - Identify addtional convience methods that need to be implemented. Any Chaff to be removed?  
     Probably the set/get "list" methods need to be removed. These may be quite dangerous.

   - Improve the documentation (check spelling! improve descriptions of methods).


   -------------------------
   Future Development Goals?
   -------------------------

   - Use of the XML::UM package. We need to handle non-UTF strings. XML::UM will
     convert UTF-8 strings to any encoding supported by XML::Encoding. 

   - Move up to the XDF 0.20 DTD standard. A major change in this DTD is the 
     MathML/units treatment.

   - Investigate and implement function nodes (see XDF_sample4.xml for an example).

   - Investigate the 'fields' pragma. Is faster primative-type datastorage possbile 
     under Perl? 

   - Allow handling of large arrays which will swamp the available memory
     (implement something like the Berkely DB module so the XDF object will act
     just like a database :) ).

   - Allow improved efficiency of datacube operations (implement something
     like the PDL module/Math::RealMatrix).

   - Need to implement a shadow array for precision on numbers within the dataCube.
     setData may adjust precision to be *lower* than declared in the relevant
     dataFormat object but may *never* insert a number with *higher* precision than
     currently exists in the dataCube. Need a $array->getPrecision($locator) method
     to identify precision on each cell.

   - Better control over Internal entities. Right now, XDF parser just replaces every
     thing. We should allow ability NOT to replace and to hang on to the entity list
     (which is printed back out with the XML from an $obj->toXMLFileHandle method call).
