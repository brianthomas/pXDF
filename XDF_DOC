This is a brief document defining various concepts in XDF.
Hopefully, we can write up something a bit more informative in 
the near future.

Some important terms/concepts associated with XDF:


"structure" : This is an object which may hold both other structures
              and arrays (see def below). Structure is a means of 
              grouping meta-data related to more than one structure or
              more than one array. The meta-data of structures are 
              usually just held within child parameter objects.

"array"     : This is an object holding both the scientific data and
              its (directly) related metadata.  These related metadata 
              include axis information, the data format of the data 
              and how to read in/write out data. Array must always
              appear within a structure. 

"datacube"  : An object holding an n-dimensional array. There is one
              (and only one) datacube for each XDF array. 

"axis"      : For each dimension represented within a given datacube
              there exists 1 axis. Each axes describes the relationship
              between the internal indexing of the data with the external
              names for indices (so-called "axisValues"; which may be 
              numbers or strings).

"fieldAxis" : This is special type of axis. Unlike the "regular" axis
              objects there can only be one (or zero) fieldAxis in each
              array object. The field axis object describes the relation
              between internal indexing of data and field objects (see
              below).

"axisValue" : A unique point on an axis; internal indices of a datacube
              are whole numbers with the origin numbered "0", however, 
              this internal number is not necessarily used by the scientist. 
              Rather, a value is ascribed to each indice; ascribed values can
              be in any arbitrary ordering but each *should* be unique to
              only one indice on the axis (in the case they are not, internal
              axis indices are available). Units may be ascribed to all axis 
              values along a given axis. Units of the data are described 
              either by fields (see below) or in an array object (above).

"field"     : Fields may exist at each index on the fieldAxis.
              Fields objects may have unique dataFormat/units that describe the 
              data format/units of *the data* that occur within the slice the field
              makes through the datacube.

"datacell"  : A unique address within the datacube that holds a single-valued 
              scalar or vector datum.  More complex data may be stored by adding
              additional axes to the datacube.


Here is a diagram showing the inter-relations between these components
of the XDF in a 2 - dimensional dataset with no fields. (more explanation here);

Here is a diagram showing the inter-relations between components
in an XDF with 1 "plain" axis and a field Axis. In this example
a hypothetical astronomical observation log is shown. Notice that
AxisValues (on axis 1) do not need to be ordered in any manner 
(relative to the internal Indices, which as above, start with '0').
Also, the field Axis allows data with varying dataformats to be held (name
fields are "string" while ""Right Ascen." and "Declination" are 
double precision a sub-type of "float"). Only a portion of the table 
is shown (and no, these are not scientifically meaningful numbers either). 

 fieldName ------> "galaxy name" "Right Ascen." "Declination" .. "?"
 fieldUnits------>   -unitless-    -unitless-     -unitless-  ..  ?
 fieldDataFormat->    -string-      -float-        -float-    ..  ?
