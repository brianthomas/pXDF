This is a brief document defining various concepts in XDF.
Hopefully, we can write up something a bit more informative in 
the near future.

Some important terms/concepts associated with XDF:


"structure" : This is an object which may hold both other structures
              and arrays (see def below). Structure is a means of 
              grouping meta-data related to more than one structure or
              more than one array. The meta-data of structures are 
              usually just held within child parameter objects.

"array"     : This is an object holding both the scientific data and
              its (directly) related metadata.  These related metadata 
              include axis information, the data format of the data 
              and how to read in/write out data. Array must always
              appear within a structure. 

"datacube"  : An object holding an n-dimensional array. There is one
              (and only one) datacube for each XDF array. 

"axis"      : For each dimension represented within a given datacube
              there exists 1 axis. Each axes describes the relationship
              between the internal indexing of the data with the external
              names for indices (so-called "axisValues"; which may be 
              numbers or strings).

"fieldAxis" : This is special type of axis. Unlike the "regular" axis
              objects there can only be one (or zero) fieldAxis in each
              array object. The field axis object describes the relation
              between internal indexing of data and field objects (see
              below).

"axisValue" : A unique point on an axis; internal indices of a datacube
              are whole numbers with the origin numbered "0", however, 
              this internal number is never used by the scientist. 
              Rather, a value is ascribed to each indice; ascribed values can
              be in any arbitrary ordering but each must be unique to
              only one indice on the axis. Units may be ascribed
              to all axis values along a given axis. Units of the
              data are described either by fields (see below) or
              in an array object (above).

"field"     : Fields may exist at each index on the fieldAxis.
              Fields objects may have units that describe the units of *the data*
              that occur within a data slice through the datacube at the indice 
              where the given field occurs.

"datacell"  : A unique address within the datacube that holds a single-valued 
              scalar or vector datum.  More complex data may be stored by adding
              additional axes to the datacube.


Here is a diagram showing the inter-relations between these components
of the XDF in a 2 - dimensional dataset with no fields.

     axisValue -----> "9" "8" "7" "6" "5" "A"  .   .  "?"
     axisIndex ----->  0   1   2   3   4   5   .   .   n
