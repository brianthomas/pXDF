There are a number of important terms/concepts associated with this model:

"datacube"  : this is an n-dimensional array. There is one
              datacube for each each array node of an
              XDF structure.

"axis"      : For each dimension within a given datacube
              there exists 1 axis. The axii describe the
              location of each datum (or datacell).

"fieldAxis" : There can only be one. This is special type of axis.

"axisValue" : A unique point on an axis; indices on an
              axis are whole numbers with the origin numbered
              "0", however, this internal number is never used
              by the scientist. Rather, a value or field is
              ascribed to each indice; ascribed values/fields can
              be in any arbitrary ordering but each must be unique to
              only one indice on the axis.  Units may be ascribed
              to all values along a given axis. Units of the
              data are described either by fields (see below) or
              in an array node attribute.

"axixValue" : AxisValues exist at every axisIndex on an axis.

"field"     : Fields may exist at each axisIndex on the fieldAxis.
              Fields have units that describe the units of *the data*
              that occur within a data slice
              through the datacube at the indice where the given
              field occurs.

"datacell"  : A unique address within the datacube that
              holds a single-valued value or vector datum.
              More complex data may be stored by adding
              additional axis to the datacube.

Here is a diagram showing the inter-relations between these components
of the XDF in a 2 - dimensional dataset with no fields.

     axisValue -----> "9" "8" "7" "6" "5" "A"  .   .  "?"
     axisIndex ----->  0   1   2   3   4   5   .   .   n
