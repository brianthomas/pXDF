	This directory contains a number of sample files 
        that illustrate various ways of holding data in XDF.

	A brief description of each is ('table' means array has a fields,
        'image' means it does not):

        document.xml          - an XML document with XDF embedded in it. 
                                The XDF table contains formatted 2D data
                                and the document has a DTD, myDocument.dtd.

        ApJ_464_79_table1.xml - an XML document with XDF embedded in it.
                                The XDF table contains tagged 2D data.

        XDF_sample1.xml       - an XDF document with single 2D formatted image. 

        XDF_sample2.xml       - an XDF document with single 2D formatted table. 

        XDF_sample3.xml       - an XDF document with single 2D tagged table.

        XDF_sample4.xml       - an XDF document with three 2D formatted images. 

        XDF_sample5.xml       - an XDF document with single 2D delmited table.

        XDF_sample6.xml       - an XDF document with single 2D formatted table 
                                stored in an external file. This data has start/endByte
                                attributes. 

        XDF_sample7.xml       - an XDF document with single 2D formatted table
                                stored in an external file as binary data. 

        XDF_sample8.xml       - an XDF document with two 2D formatted images that 
                                should be read in as one (e.g. appended by the XDF Reader). 

        XDF_sample9.xml       - an XDF document with single 2D formatted table 
                                stored in an external file, compressed with gzip.

        XDF_sample10.xml      - an XDF document with single 2D formatted table 
                                stored in an external file, compressed with bzip2.

        XDF_sample11.xml      - an XDF document with single 2D formatted table
                                stored in an external file, compressed with zip.

        XDF_sample12.xml      - same as XDF_sample3 but tagged order is reversed. 

        XDF_sample13.xml      - an XDF document with single 3D formatted image.
