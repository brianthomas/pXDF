<!--  XDF.dtd - eXtensible Data Format - version 0.18
	Date: May 17, 2002
	XML lanaguage Document Type Definition (DTD).

	An XDF document contains arrays and data structures.  It  is
designed to be both an interchange format for scientific data 
and to be of archival quality.
Multidimensional tables and scalar or vector fields are represented
in a consistent way and become thoroughly self describing.
Axial information provides a full description of  the space in which 
each datum  resides.  This means that XDF provides a consistent way to 
hold spectra with their wavelength scales, images with coordinate axes, 
vector fields with unitDirection, data cubes in complicated 
spaces, tables with column headers, and series of tables
with cut-in-heads.

<!-- The following entities allow subfield/specialty keywords to be added
to the elements: XDF, structure, array, axis, and field.  Do not change here.
Rather create a subfieldML.dtd that overrides/reverses these and XDF_TYPE and
calls XDF.dtd by a parameter entity.  Yes, DTDs can have inheritance.  It is
a bit more restrictive than Schema, but that is not necessarily bad.

<!-- An array is a set of mixed native datatype data (strings

<!--    Each dimension of an N-dimensional structure is introduced by

 	axis/valueList is a list of numbers or strings (space delimited with

	as in, the wavelength scale of a spectrum, or distance along
	the width of an image.
	In curvilinear coordinates the axis can merely

	more detailed description of the space coordinates can be accomplished
	by adding another dimension to a fieldAxis. Two dimensional data 
	would need two fieldAxis/field/@class="coordinate" maps.

A fieldAxis can also be used to hold complex number with the 
attribute complexComponent set to "imaginary" in one field and "real"
in another.  As you may have gathered, fieldAxis is a neat and  general
way to define n-tuples.
