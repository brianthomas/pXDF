<!--  XDF.dtd - eXtensible Data Format - version 0.18
	Date: June 28, 2002
	XML lanaguage Document Type Definition (DTD).

	An XDF document contains arrays and data structures.  It  is
designed to be both an interchange format for scientific data 
and to be of archival quality.
Multidimensional tables and scalar or vector fields are represented
in a consistent way and become thoroughly self describing.
Axial information provides a full description of  the space in which 
each datum  resides.  This means that XDF provides a consistent way to 
hold spectra with their wavelength scales, images with coordinate axes, 
vector fields with unitDirection, data cubes in complicated 
spaces, tables with column headers, and series of tables
with cut-in-heads.

<!-- The following entities allow subfield/specialty keywords to be added
to the elements: XDF, structure, array, axis, and field.  Do not change here.
Rather create a subfieldML.dtd that overrides/reverses these and XDF_TYPE and
calls XDF.dtd by a parameter entity.  Yes, DTDs can have inheritance.  It is
a bit more restrictive than Schema, but that is not necessarily bad.

avoid ambiguity, unless system SI units 
(http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/index.html) are used.  
When non SI are used, the singular form should be chosen.  units="unitless" 
means unitless, <units><unit></unit></units> means undefined or unknown. 
Units are multiplied together (divide by using power="-1").
Units can begin with a constant multiplier in float format (F) exponential

<!-- Conversion allows expression of an algorithm to be applied to whatever "value"
     or set of values is held by the parent node. In the case of an array or field
     or parameter it is the data/value held by that node. In the case of an axis, 
     it applies to the meaning of the axis indice values.
     One can string together a sequence of operations to be applied to the 
     stored data values. Applications would have the ability to optionally 
     apply this and to invert it when storing. The sense of the algorithm is
     that familiar to old HP users: RPN ("Reverse Polish Notation").
     For example the algorithm " 10 ^ (50 * ln (45 x + 89)) " would be written 
     <conversion>
       <multiply>45</multiply>
       <add>89</add>
